# M5 Reflections

## 1. AI Reflections

### 1.2. AI Technologies Usage

1. **Which technologies did you use?**  
We used ChatGPT to assist with the analysis and explanation of the Codacy-reported code issues in the front-end files, specifically for justifying why some issues could not be resolved.

2. **What was your goal in using these technologies?**  
Our goal was to get a better understanding of the Codacy-reported issues and to write clear, well-reasoned justifications for unfixed issues in our Testing and Code Review report.

3. **What are the advantages of using AI technologies for this goal? Describe your positive experiences.**  
Using ChatGPT helped us save time by providing detailed explanations and appropriate wording for the justifications. It also ensured our justifications were consistent, clear, and aligned with accepted software engineering principles.

4. **What are the disadvantages of using AI technologies for this goal? Describe your negative experiences.**  
AI suggestions sometimes lacked deep project-specific context and occasionally required manual refinement to ensure accuracy and relevance to our actual implementation.

5. **How much did you rely on technology (0 â€“ 100%)?**  
We relied on AI technologies for approximately **15%** of this milestone, specifically for generating explanations for Codacy issue justifications. All other parts, including writing tests, running tests, interpreting test logs, and assembling the Testing and Code Review document, were completed without AI assistance.
