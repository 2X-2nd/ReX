### Peer Review Comments

Your team's Testing and Code Review report is exemplary. The front-end Espresso tests are well-structured, targeting various user interactions effectively. Test logs and screenshots demonstrate successful execution, reflecting a mature testing process.

On the back-end, the Jest tests are thorough, covering essential APIs with both mocked and unmocked scenarios. The logical organization and clear documentation enhance the maintainability and reliability of the tests.

The inclusion of comprehensive coverage reports for both front-end and back-end showcases a commitment to code quality. The clear presentation of Codacy issues, along with well-reasoned justifications for unfixed issues, reflects a deep understanding of the codebase and potential challenges.

**Suggestions:**

- Consider adding more descriptive test names in some front-end tests to further clarify test intentions for future maintainers.
- Including a brief summary of total test coverage percentages in the report could enhance readability and provide quick insights into test completeness.

Overall, your team's work sets a high standard for testing and code review practices. Keep up the excellent work!
