## 4. Fault Identification

During the review, we identified one potential issue:

- **Fault:**  
  In the profile update flow, after an unsuccessful API call (e.g., due to network failure), the UI does not provide feedback to the user, and the loading spinner remains indefinitely visible.  
  This could confuse users as they do not know whether the update succeeded or failed.
  
  **Severity:** Medium.  
  It affects usability but does not compromise app security or core functionality.
  
  **Suggested Fix:**  
  Implement timeout or failure handling to dismiss the spinner and show an appropriate error message when the API call fails.

**Score: 10/10**
