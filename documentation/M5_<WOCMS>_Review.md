## 4. Fault Identification

During the review, we identified the following issue:

- **Fault:**  
  In the product deletion feature, when deletion fails due to server error (e.g., network failure or backend error), the UI does not display a clear error message to the user. The current flow assumes deletion success or permission denial but lacks feedback for unexpected failures.
  
  **Severity:** Medium.  
  It impacts usability in case of unexpected failures, though it does not affect the core functionality under normal conditions.
  
  **Suggested Fix:**  
  Add appropriate error handling and user feedback (Snackbar or Toast) in case of unexpected server errors during product deletion.
